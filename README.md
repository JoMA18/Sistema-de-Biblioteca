**Library Loan System**

A system to help a libary to have a control of ussers, workers and material, so it can have a better control of the books or other libary materials.
The objective is to solve the probematics of the library to have a control of those books and materials that are available at the moment or in the other hand, there arenÂ´t.

The idea is a pogram that will register most of the books, documents or other files available, but at the same time, it could register if the material is actually on loan or is available
for other users, the material will have a description as gender, title and author, and once the usser take it on loan, they will be available to check the information and dates.

The usser will be defined with an ID, name, number or contact, and a borrowed book record; the material as books or files will be part of the library, and of course the principal objecct: the library; 
also the idea of a loan, that will have the dates and the characteristics of the material loan, and finally the librarian that have an ID and a role.
